    "# The \"RecSys Startup Sprint\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, everyone. Welcome to the \"RecSys Startup Sprint.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You've spent the last few years learning the theory. Now, you have **one month** to prove you're not just students, but engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your cohort of 20 groups will function as 20 competing startups. Your goal is to build, deploy, and demo a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** of an *innovative* recommender system, based on a concept from the RecSys papers I've provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me be clear. We are **not** building a simple baseline. I don't want to see another report on `k-NN` or standard `Matrix Factorization`. You are skipping straight to the advanced part. You will live or die by the quality of your GNN, your LLM, your context-aware model, or your fairness-enhanced algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It frees you from building a \"control\" model, but it means your evaluation must be *flawless*. You have nothing to hide behind. You must prove your complex model is actually learning, not just memorizing the most popular items.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to make this real, you're not just convincing me. You're convincing your peers. At the end of this sprint, you will all vote for the best project. The top 3 teams, as decided by *your* peers, will receive a grade bonus. This is your \"market validation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your focus is **80% on the algorithm, data, and evaluation, and 20% on the infrastructure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in a 5-person startup, *everyone* codes. There are no \"project managers\" who only make charts."

    "\n",
    "In your Week 1 Plan, you must assign these 5 roles. Everyone implements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Project Lead (PL):** Manages the project plan, schedule, and repository (Git).\n",
    "    * **Technical Responsibility:** Owns the **evaluation harness** and **model-specific data preprocessing**. They define the offline metrics ($NDCG@10$, $Recall@20$), write the testing script, and build the data-processing pipeline to feed the model (e.g., graph construction for a GNN).\n",
    "2.  **Data Engineer (DE):** Owns the **data pipeline and storage**.\n",
    "    * **Technical Responsibility:** Sources, cleans, and stores the V1 dataset. Builds the data-capture endpoint (e.g., `/log_interaction`) for new real-world interactions and the database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) to store them.\n",
    "3.  **Lead ML Engineer (MLE-Core):** Owns the **core model implementation**.\n",
    "    * **Technical Responsibility:** Implements the architecture from the chosen RecSys paper (e.g., the `PyTorch Geometric` implementation of the GNN).\n",
    "4.  **ML Engineer (MLE-Ops):** Owns the **model training and serving logic**.\n",
    "    * **Technical Responsibility:** Writes the training/validation loop, manages hyperparameters, saves model artifacts, and writes the core \"predict\" function that the API will call.\n",
    "5.  **Systems Engineer (SE):** Owns the **full stack application**.\n",
    "    * **Technical Responsibility:** Builds the `FastAPI`/`Flask` backend, the API endpoints, the `Streamlit`/`React` frontend, and manages the final deployment (local or cloud). See \"Note on Deployment & Tech Stack\" bellow."

    "    * For instance if you choose to implement a GNN-based model. Your innovation could be:\n",
    "        * Context-Awareness: Augmenting your GNN with temporal data (time of day) or session-based features.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Fairness/Diversity: Implementing a re-ranking layer on top of your model's output to mitigate popularity bias.\n",
